            <p>I&#39;ve had a habit of registering new domain names frequently, just like how I&#39;ve been starting personal blogs once in a while just to abandon them again after six months. But that&#39;s another story. My quest for a good domain name is not new, and the recent release of various new top level domain names got me interested once again. Problem is, they all suck.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a bunch of new generic top level domain names usable by anybody for almost anything, but instead most of them are very specific and niché oriented. 
<em>.museum</em>? <em>.kitchen</em>? <em>.vodka</em>? What were they thinking?? I&#39;m surprised if there is a need for more than a few thousand vodka sites globally, maybe ten thousand all in all if every brand and every vodka club (is that a thing?) needs its own homepage.</p>
<p>Sure, at the time of this writing, there are a few new generic top level domain names as well, but they are all wierd or &quot;funny&quot; like <em>.ninja</em> and <em>.guru</em>. While it&#39;s a fun exercise to come up with a good name that goes with ninja, the novelty quickly wears off. And while it sounds like a fun idea to register <em>&quot;your name&quot;.ninja</em> just for the heck if it, it&#39;s doubtful you&#39;ll actually use it for anything useful, least of all your personal blog (unless you are an actual ninja, in which case, what are you waiting for?).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I had been hoping for: <em>.dot</em>, <em>.web</em>, <em>.www</em>, <em>.site</em>, or anything generic, short, and &quot;not stupid sounding&quot; when read out aloud. The closest thing we got right now is <em>.xyz</em>, which is just a tad too cryptic to be any good. We also have <em>.place</em>, but it&#39;s a bit too long to be any good (and also too expensive to register).</p>
<p>I get why a lot of startups and geeks like <em>.cc</em>, <em>.io</em>., <em>.co</em>. They are short and techy, and they don&#39;t look stupid. (<em>.io</em> is also quite expensive these days for that reason, I think.) </p>
<p>Personally, I hope that something like <em>.dev</em> will be available for developers around the world some day. That&#39;s the kind of top level domain name we need. Short (no more than three letters) and broad (dev is for all developers all over the world), yet not to specific (like <em>.democrat</em>) or niché (like <em>.surgery</em> - <em>.healthcare</em> makes a lot more sense).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#39;s just my two cents. And I&#39;m sure the situation is completely different in a few years from now. I ended up registering <em>kdo.dk</em> since I&#39;m Danish and <em>.dk</em> domains are cheap to register (for danes at least).  I&#39;ll try to stick with it for more than six months this time.</p>
