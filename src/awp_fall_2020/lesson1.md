Full **Course plan** is available on Canvas. It’s a rough overview of the contents of the lessons. Changes to the plan will likely be made.

Weekly **Lesson plans** are always up to date, and generally available the week before each lesson.

You are expected to read the lesson plans when they become available and prepare accordingly (homework!)

This course could also have been named:

**Full-Stack JavaScript Web App Development and Deployment**

But we went for the title that is easier to remember and doesn't need to be changed when the technology changes :)

Everything in this course will be based on **JavaScript**.

If you feel the need to “brush up” a bit, have a look at the recommended resources below:
- Mozilla: A re-introduction to JavaScript (short tutorial)
- LinkedIn Learning: Javascript Essential Training (video)
- Eloquent JavaScript (interactive e-book, challenges the way you think about computers – available on GitHub)
- https://javascript.info/ (nice extensive tutorial, covers all the basics and some more – available on GitHub)

#### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network
This is my go-to resource for documentation about web development, especially JavaScript. It explains just about anything you need to know about JavaScript and covers all relevant APIs. 

#### React Docs
The official React docs are valuable to understand the fundamental concepts. They also have a practical tutorial if you want hands-on experience straight away.

- Package specific docs on https://www.npmjs.com (links will be provided in each lesson).

Exercises are central to the learning goals in this course. Solving all exercises from each lesson is the best way to learn what you need for the exam. 

Being able to understand a particular solution is not enough. **Being able to independently arrive at a proper solution for a given exercise is what really matters.**

I only give out solutions for certain exercises, but I provide plenty of examples to learn from. And if you feel an example is missing, let me know, and I will make another one!

This course is not designed to be a "self-study" course. 

You will miss out on important activities and information if you don't attend class.

When attending class, I usually register absence in the morning (between 8.30 and 8.40). This is my duty as a teacher.
