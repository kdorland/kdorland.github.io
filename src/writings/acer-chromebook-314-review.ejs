    <h1>Acer Chromebook 314 Review - Developer Perspective</h1>

    <h3><time datetime="2020-02-26">2020-02-25</time></h3>

    <p>When my old Lenovo IdeaPad finally died in January of 2020, I didn't really think I needed another laptop to replace it. I already own an iPad, a desktop PC (mostly used by the rest of the family), a smartphone, and some other very capable devices – not to mention my HP EliteBook laptop for work, which I never take home from the office anyway. But none of my devices at home, except for my desktop PC, are any good for writing or coding. And I’m too tired to sit in front of a PC in the evening after at long day of work. Sitting in the couch or bed after the children have been tucked in is much preferred.</p>

    <p>Enter the Chromebook. For only twice the price of an official iPad (2017) Smart Keyboard accessory you can get this nice little machine. I even got 33% off the price, so a very nice deal indeed. This is basically the cheapest laptop I’ve ever owned.</p>

    <p>But how does it stack up? Part of the reason I wanted a Chromebook was also to experience if it could replace an ordinary Windows / Mac / Linux laptop for certain tasks.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>

    <p>But let me first tell you are little about the hardware. It has a nice 14” full-HD touch-capable screen with nice colors and everything. A definite improvement compared to my old Lenovo, which, by the way, also had a 14” full-HD touchscreen. You can easily tell how screen technology has progressed in those six years.</p>

    <p>The keyboard is nice and works well – no complaints here. You just have to get used to the slightly different layout on Chromebooks. Windows-key and Function-keys are missing, but the latter can be emulated using alt+numbers. And there are some new keys to get used to as well like the “search key”.</p>

    <p>Touchpad is also nice and works well despite the cheap material it’s made from. While the build quality of the machine is fine, it’s mostly built from cheap plastic - or at least, that how it feels. The “metal look” is deceiving, but I personally don’t mind. On the plus side, it’s a very light weight machine.</p>

    <p>It has four USB ports in total, two type-c and two type-a. You also get a headphone jack and a card reader. You charge if from the type-c ports, which is nice. I have only charged it once so far, thanks to the 12-hour battery life (which is closer to 10 hours when you use it for intensive tasks). You can charge it with the same kind of charger most modern phones use. Just be aware that it needs to be a powerful charger (something with “Quick Charge” will likely do).</p>

    <p>One very nice thing is that the machine is completely fan-less. Coupled with a (small 64 GB) SSD means that there are no moving parts and no sound produced from the machine itself. The noise was one of the things I hated the most about the Lenovo.</p>

    <h2>Chrome OS</h2>

    <p>Central to the machine is the operating system. Luckily, Chrome OS has been a breeze to use. It just works. Updates come in automatically and seem to install quickly when you decide to reboot. Not hour-long updates with several reboots like with some other OS. It’s quick to boot, but you never really shut it down anyway. It doesn’t use much power when the lid is closed, and it instantly turns on when you open it.</p>

    <p>Chrome OS is very easy to use, mostly because you can’t really do much with it. You have your app toolbar at the bottom of the screen, an app drawer, some settings, and that’s basically it. And of course, the Chrome browser, which lets you install Chrome apps (until that feature <a href="https://developers.chrome.com/apps/migration">disappears later this year</a>).</p>

    <p>But obviously I didn’t stop there. One of the main reasons for giving Chromebooks a try is to try the integrated Linux support. You enable it in the settings (it’s still in beta), and then you get a Linux terminal which seems to be backed by a full Debian installation. All my usual packages are easily installed with “apt-get” much to my surprise.</p>

    <p>I should probably also mention that you get the Google Play Store with full Android support. In fact, I’m writing this on my Chromebook in the Android version of Microsoft Word.</p>

    <p>Even though I like Chrome, I’m using Firefox as my primary browser for various ideological and technical reasons. On a Chromebook, that basically means running the Android version or the Linux version. I opted for the latter since I don’t really enjoy using the mobile Firefox app in full screen.</p>

    <h2>Software for development</h2>

    <p>For development, I tried to install Visual Studio Code, but quickly gave up. There are .deb packages available but I didn’t try them. I don’t think they enable auto-updating. I ended up installing the full WebStorm IDE from JetBrains, which I already love and use at work, and to my surprise, it actually runs fairly well on this machine. Installation was also a breeze: just unpack and create a symlink for the executable. The performance obviously takes a dive compared to what I’m used to from my other machines, but I find it quite usable even on this limited hardware. For a bit of hobby programming, it works very well. I could also see myself occasionally using it for more serious work.</p>

    <p>Since you have the full Debian distribution available, nothing prevents you from simply installing emacs, vim, and all the other classic development tools and use them from the terminal. Or simply use the terminal to “ssh” into more powerful computers. For that, this machine would be perfect.</p>

    <h2>Software for entertainment</h2>

    <p>I have yet to try any Android games on this thing. To be honest, the type of games that interest me currently are better suited for an iPad or PC. But I did run some old DOS games using a web based version of DOSBox, and they worked perfectly well.</p>

    <p>I have also been streaming some YouTube and Amazon Prime, and while YouTube works well as expected, I’m having some performance issues with Prime where it occasionally lags in the audio. Not enough to bother me, but not perfect either. I tried streaming Prime both in Chrome and using the native Android app – same issue. I have yet to try Netflix (not currently subscribing).</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>This is a nice little machine with all the right trade-offs. For the price, I couldn’t be happier. And even though it is limited in various ways, it also has long battery life, is light weight, looks and feels nice (even if a bit cheap) and very usable software. I really don’t see it as a downgrade from a Windows laptop, but as a cheaper alternative with its own strengths and weaknesses. I also see it as more of a “real computer” than an iPad, though I still prefer the iPad when it comes to consuming media and playing games.</p>
