# Eve Echoes - journal entry #3
This will be my last journal for now since I just decided to stop playing. It wasn't a bad game, and I'm impressed with what NetEase has archived, but it wasn't for me. Instead of a longwinded and probably boring analysis, I'm going to give this some closure by simply summerizing the main reasons I didn't enjoy the game after roughly 1.5 month of play.

## Reason 1: All the benefits of a PC game with all the downsides
The game looks great and is a technical marvel of a mobile game. There is nothing quite like it. It also takes long to load, not just because of heavy graphics, but because the developers decided I should go through an intro movie (which can be skipped) and a character selection screen every time I open the app - just like in some PC games. And then it loads the game, connects to the server etc. That's a lot of waiting if you only have five minutes. Not only that, unless you have a beefy mobile with lots of RAM, Android (or iOS) will probably shutdown the game as soon as you even think the word "multi-tasking". Checking your email will probably force you to go through the complete load procedure once more when you navigate back into the app. Basically, this wasn't meant for mobile - at least not most mobiles.

There are ways around it of course. You could keep a second device just for eve, buy a premium phone that probably keeps the game open for longer, or use an emulator on PC. But we are talking about work-arounds here. As a purely mobile experience, this is clearly not optimal, unless you have a premium phone I suppose (unverified).

## Reason 2: Lack of content
Well, I did play the original eve back in 2006, and I think it actually had less content than this and was way less polished, so there's that. But for some reason, I'm not willing to put up with the same lack of content 14 years later. If the content was more polished or more fun than it is right now, it might not be a deal-breaker, but right now, I think it's one of the main issues with the game. 

As an example, there isn't much on the market yet in this game. I'm not even talking about lack of ships, since I actually think there is plenty. It's more about lack of everything else. There isn't many modules or drone types, and no ammo at all. Also, encounters quickly get boring. And mining is actually more boring than in the PC-version since you don't even have to worry about rats. Basically, unless you invest your time in PvP or null sec alliances, I doubt you will find much new to do after a month or two of play-time. 

## Reason 3: The market is broken
There is so much wrong with the market that I won't even try to cover everthing here. Just see this reddit thread instead: https://www.reddit.com/r/echoes/comments/ij7c1p/the_market_is_very_broken/

I'm personally most worried about the following:
- Lack of tools. No easy way to see how much an item is sold, for instance.
- Lack of information. The fact that you can't see what you sold and who bought it makes it really hard to track the status of your orders. All you can do is see money going into your wallet and no precise info about where it came from. This is a huge mistake. 
- Heavy taxes. I see no reason for this. Basically there is a 15% tax on everything (can be lowered a bit with max skill levels) and at least 7.5% brokers fee (might be higher - forgot if I did train it a bit). At least the brokers fee was removed on direct sales in a recent patch. 

## Reason 4: Pay to win
Well, I'm not actually bothered by people getting ahead in their skills by paying premium. But the fact that people who spend a lot of time managing several accounts are the ones who ends up controlling the market, is a huge deterrence to someone like me who just wants to have casual fun producing and selling stuff. And since the market is so small (se Reason 2), there is basically no way for me to find a niche where I can have fun in this segment of the game. This could be alleviated by banding together in a corp and specialize and coordinate I guess, but that is kinda hard with the awful communcation tools in the game (see next reason). Also, I had the same complaint about the original eve (I basically had to give up on invention back in 2008 because I didn't want to compete with armies of industri-trained "alts"), but designing a new game is also a chance for fix things. No such luck here. 

## Reason 5: Communication sucks
Yeah, you are not meant to write to people directly. The interface sucks and is buggy as hell. Clearly the developers would rather have you just use Discord like they do themselves. It just doesn't work well for contacting players in-game since you don't automatically know their Discord handle from within echoes. I mean, local chat is fun in some of the highly populated systems, and corp chat seems to work well, but everything else is broken - especially the lack of direct messaging. Instead you have a hard to access direct character chat that doesn't work half the time. And where are the character biographies where you could put relevant and important info for other players to read (like your Discord username)?

## Conclusion
I might give Echoes another try if they make any major changes. It's not a bad game, but it requires more time and effort to enjoy than I'm willing to give it currently, and the amount of fun stuff is still very limited. As I wrote in Journal #2, my dream mobile space mmo is a bit like eve, but without any of the downsides of a PC game (graphics really doesn't matter much to me) and a critical look at all the original design decisions of the original eve. I mean, they did fix a few things, like eliminating T2 BPOs and improve the auto-pilot, but they could have done so much more. Maybe a mobile Eve is just not what I want, but it is currently the closest thing to what I dream of in a handheld mobile space mmo.
