# Eve Echoes - Journal Entry 1
I got late into the game, or early actually, depending on how you look at things. You see, if this is the game to play for the next many year, being among the players starting in the first few weeks would make you one of the very first. But on the other hand, if the game dies after a few months, starting three weeks into the game would make you late. 

I never knew what I signed up for, I just knew that yet another spin-off of the infamous Eve Online by CCP was being released, this time for mobile, but I had no idea what type of game it would be. I haven't really followed up on any Eve news in years. My last time playing Eve Online seriously was in early 2008, twelve years ago. I tried to get back into the game a few times after that, but never stayed for more than a few months. To me, the magic was gone. 

So I installed the game on my phone, started the character creating process, curious to see what they had come up with. Hopefully something fun to kill time with whenever I was out and about with only my phone as entertainment. I was greeted with a fun tutorial and got a new AI friend which I got to name. Turned out the gameplay was very similar to desktop Eve Online. Flying ships, warping between gates, docking at stations, killing other ships, and so on. The interface was, thankfully, much different, but the beautiful soundtrack from the PC version was intact. Also, the ships and the colorful starfilled backgrounds looked exactly the way I remembered them. This was unexpected. Had they actually adapted the PC-version for mobile - just like that?

At this point, I had to look up articles of Eve Echoes to figure out what I had gotten into. Turns out this game had been in beta for a while, developed by chinese game developer NetEase, and they seemed to have done a pretty good job at it as well. The game was obviously simplifed in ways, and adapting for mobile also meant making the game more casual, but I was okay with that. As long as I could still get killed in a gatecamp on my way to null sec, it felt like Eve. And I certainly didn't mind being able to turn on the auto-pilot and have my ship warp around safely in high-sec without even having the app open. 

I spent the first few weeks doing simple missions... sorry, I meant "encounters", while relieving good old memories of doing "level 4"s in my Armageddon battleship while grinding standing with my favorite agents. I actually like the new encounter system and don't really miss having to grind "standing" with your agents (to access better mission content). But I got bored a bit after that, and started "ratting" instead, meaning hunting down NPC pirates for bounty. 

I have decided on a career path I never pursued fully in Eve Online. I want to do industry and mine my own materials. So right now, I'm mining away in high-sec, while afk, in my Venture II, having a bit of fun finding the good spots and the good deals on the market, wondering how to be profitable at more than just selling raw ore. I guess I could look up wikis, make spreadsheets, and figure out the numbers. But I've decided to simply treat Eve Echoes as a mobile game and see how it goes. If it stops being fun, I'll try something else in the game, or maybe just stop playing again.
